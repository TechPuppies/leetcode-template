// Reverse digits of an integer.
// Example1: x =  123, return  321
// Example2: x = -123, return -321

// Have you thought about this?
// Here are some good questions to ask before coding. Bonus points for you if you
// If the integer's last digit is 0, what should the output be? ie, cases such as
// Did you notice that the reversed integer might overflow? Assume the input is a
// 32-bit integer, then the reverse of 1000000003 overflows. How should you handle
// Throw an exception? Good, but what if throwing an exception is not an option?
