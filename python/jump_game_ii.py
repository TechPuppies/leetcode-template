# 
# Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
# 
# 
# Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position. 
# 
# 
# Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.
# 
# 
# For example:
# Given array A = [2,3,1,1,4]
# 
# 
# The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. (Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.)
# 
# 


class Solution:
    # @param A, a list of integers
    # @return an integer
    def jump(self, A):
