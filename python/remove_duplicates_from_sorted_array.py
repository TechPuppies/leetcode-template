# 
# 
# Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.
# 
# Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.
# 
# 
# For example,
# Given input array A = [1,1,2],
# 
# 
# Your function should return length = 2, and A is now [1,2].
# 
#

    # @param a list of integers
    # @return an integer
