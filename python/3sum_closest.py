# Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the sum is
# closest to a given number, target. Return the sum of the three integers. You
#     For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1.
#     The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

class Solution:
    # @return an integer
