# 
# Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).
# 
# 
# Assume a BST is defined as follows:
# 
# The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
# The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
# Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
#

# confused what "{1,#,2,3}" means? > read more on how binary tree is serialized on OJ.
# OJ's Binary Tree Serialization:
# 
# The serialization of a binary tree follows a level order traversal, where '#' signifies a path terminator where no node exists below.
# 
# 
# Here's an example:
# 
#    1
#   / \
#  2   3
#     /
#    4
#     \
#      5
# 
# The above binary tree is serialized as "{1,2,3,#,#,4,#,#,5}".

    # @param root, a tree node
