# 
# Design and implement a data structure for Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. It should support the following operations: get and set.
# 
# 
# get(key) - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
# set(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reached its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item.

class LRUCache:

    # @param capacity, an integer
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        

    # @return an integer
    def get(self, key):
        

    # @param key, an integer
    # @param value, an integer
    # @return nothing
    def set(self, key, value):
