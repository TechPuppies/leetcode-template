Leetcode Template
=================
This is a crawler script for leetcode.


It generates code templates for you,
so you don't have to create new file for each 'leetcode problem'.


Hope it will save you some time. Wish you find a better job.


There might be a lot of bugs, please let me know.
Thank you!
