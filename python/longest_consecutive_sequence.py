# 
# Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
# 
# 
# For example,
# Given [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2],
# The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Return its length: 4.
# 
# 
# Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.
#

class Solution:
    # @param num, a list of integer
    # @return an integer
